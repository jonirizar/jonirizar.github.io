I am a Ph.D. student in Financial Economics at Copenhagen Business School. My research focuses on the applications of Behavioral Finance to the intersection of Household Finance and Asset Pricing, focusing on retail investor behavior. I implement machine learning and causal inference techniques for such analyses.
